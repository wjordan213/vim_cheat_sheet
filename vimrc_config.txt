This contains input for the command-line when configuring vim with my vimrc file on a new computer

# first, my dotfiles repo needs to be downloaded to ~/code on whatever computer I'm using

# Create the symlink to the existing vimrc file
ln -s ~/code/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc

# put this in ~/.inputrc to allow for vim command line normal mode
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi-command

throw these two lines on the command line whenever on a new comp. a few base configurations that are nice

-mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
-curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpope/vim-sensible/master/plugin/sensible.vim > ~/.vim/plugin/sensible.vim

Things to implement on future vimrc:
